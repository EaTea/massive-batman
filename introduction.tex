\section{Introduction}

When you attend a presentation, what convinces you that the speaker is meaningfully communicating
information to you?
Furthermore, how can you objectively assess a presenter and elicit that they are ``good"
communicators?\\
\\
These questions, in the context of science communication, provide a guiding aim and motivation for
this work.
Addressing each of these questions involves a foray into a vast field on
communication theory and presentation skills.
Instead, I will provide insights into each of these questions through an assessment of a speaker
(Section \ref{semRev}), a review of presentation assessment tools (Section \ref{rubReview}) and an
essay on what makes a good science communication (Section \ref{discussion}).
