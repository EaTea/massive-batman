\maketitle

The key message for my presentation is

\begin{quote}
	If you know about pixels, you can start making images on your computer look awesome.
\end{quote}

I was concentrating on delivering my talk to students who had used computers and had experienced
problems when using images on a computer before.\\
\\
I chose this topic because images appear on digital screens everywhere.
Our recent focus on using Photoshop and the usefulness of images in science communication made me
curious about the underlying image representations on a computer.
After researching this topic, I felt that there were interesting cases relevant to my peers,
especially in a period of time where we are surrounded by technology.
Making images look good or appropriate for these cases was something that I felt focused my talk and
made it relevant for my peers and audience.
The three cases that I chose to focus on in my talk were

\begin{enumerate}
	\item printing images from a computer ended up with different colours
	\item changing the size of an image filled it with squares
	\item viewing images on the Internet takes a long time
\end{enumerate}
