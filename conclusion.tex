\section{Conclusion}

We have captured the essence of what makes a good science communicator into three points

\begin{enumerate}
	\item clear, relevant key messages
	\item jargon minimisation
	\item confidence in body language and gestures
\end{enumerate}

We have supported these claims with empirical evidence and concepts from communication theory.
However, these three points extend beyond just science communication --- they are also applicable to speaking
in general.
They are foundations for becoming a good public speaker and communicator that are justified by
opinion, and by scientific literature.
